Analysis Purpose:
The purpose of the analysis  for Kate to convince investors that a bike sharing program
in Des Moines is a good business proposal. Stakeholders requested a bike trip analysis. The data being used is from Citi Bike in New York.
So the data needs to be scrutinized since it doe not specifically pertain to Des Moines.

For the business propsal I will be using data visualization software, Tableau. Tableau allows the data to be imported and portrayed accurately. 
With Tableau I will create worksheets, stories and dashboards with the New York Citi Bike data.  


Results:

Seven visualizations for the NYC Citibike adata have been created. The story details August peak hours, ridership, ridership by gender and ending location.
It is important to recognize that this data is only a comparison to what a bike business in Des Moine can achieve. The bike sharing program is a great way for 
people to exercise, lessen the stress on the transportation infrastructure in the city and for people to see the city at their leisure.
